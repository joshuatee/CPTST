/**
  * The Scene Controller script needs to be attach to a controller object. This
  * is usually a small object or an object without a mesh that is placed near
  * the start of your scene. The controller object needs to be defined as a
  * Volume and to have a fairly large Collision Shape - when someone enters this
  * shape, the scene will be started.
  *
  * Paramters and Customizers
  * -------------------------------------------
  * Draft Key (Key)
  * - The Draft Key is simply a key that you have created in the builder. Give
  * it a name that reflects the scene. It will be used to manage the cast in the
  * Draft version of your build.
  * - All objects in the scene must specify the same Draft key value on the
  * Registration calls.
  * 
  * Published Key (Key)
  * - The Published Key is simply a key that you have created in the builder.
  * Give it a name that reflects the scene. It will be used to manage the cast
  * in the Published version of your build.
  * - All objects in the scene must specify the same Published key value on the
  * Registration calls.
  *
  * Duration (Number)
  * - The expected duration of the scene in Seconds.
  * - Once started, the scene will not restart until the duration has passed and
  * the end scene events have been generated (unless you reset the scene
  * controller object, but this isn't a good idea as the other objects in the
  * scene may be half way through whatever they are meant to be doing).
  *
  * Execution
  * -------------------------------------------
  * - When the script initializes it sets up a 5 second timer to monitor the cast
  * list for the scene (see the Register script for more details).
  * - When a player enters the collision volume of the controller object it
  * catches the event, sends a start message to each member of the cast and sets
  * up a timer for the end of the scene.
  * - When the end of scene timer pops it sends a stop message to each cast
  * member.
  *
  * Notes
  * -------------------------------------------
  * - If the scene controller object is going to host any other scene functions
  * (sounds or direction) it needs to have the Scene Register script on it as well.
  *
  * Source.
