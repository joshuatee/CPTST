/*
 * This script makes players do things during a scene. It's fairly fragile as
 * the player is able to interrupt the actions it tells them to take by simply
 * moving. Due to the security system, it'll probably only work if you own
 * the land you place it on.
 *
 * Paramters and Customizers
 * -------------------------------------------
 * Delay (Number)
 * - This is how long, in seconds, after the scene starts that the action
 * should be requested. Note that at the begining of a scene it is quite likely
 * that a player is still moving and will thus override any early movement
 * instructions.
 * 
 * Marker (String)
 * - The name of the marker on the object the script is attached to that the
 * player should move to. Once they get there they will do whatever animation
 * the marker is coded to make them play.
 *
 * Detatch Delay (Number)
 * - This is how long, in seconds, after the player is told to perform the
 * action that they should be detatched from the object that's hosting the script.
 * If you don't want them detatched, code a value of -1. Why detatch them?
 * Because if you don't and the object moves they will get dragged along with it,
 * even if they are no longer onboard.
 *
 * Execution
 * -------------------------------------------
 * When the scene start signal arrives it sets up a timer to scedule the action.
 * The action is simply passed onto the player and then another timer may be
 * set up for the detatch, if one is needed.
 *
